# C# Flight GUI System

C# Flight GUI System is an innovative Windows Forms application designed for simulating and managing flight paths and airport layouts. This application features a user-friendly graphical interface that allows users to interactively manage flights, place and manipulate airport elements, and simulate various airport and flight operations. The system supports loading comprehensive flight and airport data from `.ftr` files, offering users a dynamic and flexible tool for flight management simulations. With the integration of C# multithreading, the application ensures a seamless and responsive user experience, capable of handling complex simulations and real-time data processing.

## Features

- **Interactive Flight Management**: A graphical user interface for visualizing and managing flight paths and airport layouts.
- **FTR File Support**: Ability to load flight and airport data from `.ftr` files for dynamic simulation scenarios.
- **Multithreading**: Leverages C# multithreading to ensure smooth performance during data loading and simulation processes.
- **Flight and Airport Customization**: Users can interactively place, move, and rotate airport elements and flight paths within the simulation.
- **Real-time Simulation Feedback**: Provides immediate visual feedback on flight path adjustments and airport layout changes.
